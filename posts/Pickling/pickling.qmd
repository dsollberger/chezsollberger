These days, I try to keep garlic, cucumbers, and carrots (and maybe peppers and/or onions) always available in my refrigerator for convenience.  I tend to prefer an Asian-style pickling juice (base: rice vinegar), and this recipe is adapted from a Martha Stewart [post](https://www.marthastewart.com/1154496/asian-pickles).

* caution: I am not a food safety expert nor have I assured that the following will abide by food safety regulations

For each desired Mason jar of food ...

## base

* 2 cups of rice vinegar
* 1/3 cup of coarse salt

## flavoring

* 1 cup sugar
* 1 tsp red chili paste (more to preference)
* 2 cloves garlic (chopped)

... and boil together.

That is, if I am pickling garlic or onions, or peppers, I only need to mix the base.  If I am pickling cucumbers or carrots, then I would add the flavors too.
